Chang Liu is a 5th-year Ph.D. student in [Computational Imaging Systems Lab](https://sites.bu.edu/tianlab/) at Boston University, specializing in **deep learning, computational imaging, and signal processing**. His research focuses on developing self-supervised video denoising frameworks for high-speed fluorescence imaging, leveraging generative models for uncertainty quantification, and integrating advanced computational methods into imaging systems to enhance experimental efficiency. 

Chang is actively seeking opportunities as a Machine Learning Engineer or Research Scientist, where he can apply his expertise in deep learning and computational imaging to solve real-world challenges. Chang has extensive experience with Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow), C++, MATLAB, and a range of deep learning techniques, including **self-supervised learning, diffusion models, and transformer-based architectures**.

Before joining Boston University, Chang earned his M.S. from Carnegie Mellon University and his B.S. from Tsinghua University, working on projects in biomedical signal processing, brain-computer interfaces, and neuromodulation.
