Chang Liu is a 4th-year Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at Boston University. Chang joined [Computational Imaging Systems Lab](https://sites.bu.edu/tianlab/) advised by [Prof. Lei Tian](https://sites.bu.edu/tianlab/people/lei-tian/) in 2021 working on deep learning and computational imaging. His current work is developing deep-learning-based denoising algorithms for ultra-fast, large-scale, high-resolution neural imaging. 

Chang is expertized in **self-supervised learning, image/video denoising, and biomedical signal processing**. He is proficient in Python, MATLAB, and common deep learning tools including PyTorch and TensorFlow. His research interests include **deep learning, computational imaging, signal processing, brain-computer interfaces, and neuromodulation**.

Previously, Chang received his B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Tsinghua University in China and performed research in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) aiming to increase the speed of BCI spellers. He received his M.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where he conducted research in transcranial-focused ultrasound (tFUS) neuromodulation.
